TRANSECT
A transect is defined as an imaginary line demarcated by six permanent markers 
(stainless steel eyebolts or rebar stakes) placed at distances of 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 
40 m along the transect.  Most transects run parallel to shore, generally at 
headings of 80 or 90 degrees.  Before sampling is begun, a surveyors transect tape is 
attached to the 0 m bolt, swum through the eyes of 8, 16, 24, and 32 meter bolts of 
the transect, pulled taut, and attached to the 40 m bolt.

DISTANCE
The sampling protocol for the UPC data dictates a sample is taken both on the inshore and offshore side at each meter along the 40 meter transect.  The DISTANCE variable records this information.  Note: in some cases there are multiple data points for a particular distance and side of transect.  This occurs when there is a "layering effect" of multiple species at the same point.  

SIDE
Data point is represents data collected on either the inshore (I) or offshore (O) side of the transect.

SP_CODE
These data represent a three or four letter species code for the species recorded at each point contact.  Generally, codes are the first letter of the genus followed by the first letter of the species name.  Some codes are four letters, the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. The specific Genus species name and other taxonomic information for each code can be found in the file "SBC-LTER_Species_List.xls".
"0" data points in the SPECIES_CODE column represent points where no species was found. substrate also included in this list.

SUBSTRTE
The type of substrate is recorded for each point contact.  The following is a list and short description of each substrate type.

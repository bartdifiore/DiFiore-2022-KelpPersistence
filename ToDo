  Met w/ Raine. Discussed how to best compare the model predictions to the observations. The idea that we had was to not focus on observed vs. predicted, but rather to focus on the question at hand: use the model to interrogate the effect of historical kelp variability on kelp community structure. Basically the idea is to use the model in the conceptual figure. Then use the model to explore the predictor variables. Specifically, regress the model predictions against the metrics of kelp variability. Then we will have estimates for when and where we might expect to see a statistical difference in community structure.

  Met w/ Raine. Discussed her figures that she generated on time since disturbance. Decided to pursue that as a path forward. Raine w/ generate a similar figure for frequency of disturbance. 
  
  Outline of figures: 
    1. Conceptual: map + path diagram? + two simulated model runs from sites at opposite ends of the spectrum
    2. Theoretical synthesis of the effects of time since disturbance and disturbance frequency w/ scouring on SI and UA biomass
    3. Statistical figure (see 4panel_bayesresult.png)
    4. ? maybe species level figure ?

  - Decided to focus on this manuscript for Ch. 3
  - Met w/ Raine
  - Revise conceptual figure
    - generate two panels from the model results
    - generate two more panels with bar/dot plots with the predicted values from 2018 vs. the observed
  - Pair the "pertrubations" w/ the time series such that I can tell when the perturbations occured
  - Revise coef plot (Fig. 2) 
  - Reconstruct (Fig. 3)
    - pair model predictions with observations
    - two 3 panel plots
  - Conduct species level analysis
    - pull out top 10 UA and SI by biomass 
    - run statistical models on each (biomass ~ time_since + perturbations + covariates)
    - generate some sort of summary plot (horizontal bar plot, species on the y, response to time_since | perturbations on the X) 
    - Bullet out methods and results
    - Send to committee and then send to Adrian, Holly, Dan, Bob, Max, and Raine

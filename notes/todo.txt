To Do: 


- Confirm with Li about substrate data from noncore sites. Have you run the analysis to extract the substrate data based on her code. Rerun 4_mergepersitence-species.R so that I know we have the right data. 


- Draft up NMDS to send to An for refining. Are transects with similar histories more similar? or are transects more similar to other transects at the same site? 

- Compare observations to Raine's model predictions.
